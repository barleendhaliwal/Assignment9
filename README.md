Add created on and modified on columns to all the tables. These should auto populate. Push the code to the repo on github. Generate a PR for review.

This can be done in 2 ways:
1. Use Triggers - TriggerCode folder contains the trigger functions and triggers which can be created on pgAdmin - This approach will work with the code of the previous assignment.
2. Modify Queries - In this code on Server side gets modified. Check ModifiedQueries folder for this.

Note: In both ways properties "createdOn" and "modifiedOn" need to be added to all tables
